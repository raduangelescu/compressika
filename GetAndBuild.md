#Guide to building compressika

# How can I build Compressika? #
Building Compressika should be easy. You only need visual studio 2008 or 2011 beta.
  * Check out the svn at
http://compressika.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ compressika-read-only
  * you can use whatever svn client you prefer (I use Tortoise svn)
  * Open the sln file of your enviroment (2008 or 2011) and hit build.(This project does not have any extra dependencies, except CImg)
  * If you want to test the fractal compression with jpg images, you need to install the image magick library (wich is also provided on the svn)
