= How to use : Compress/Uncompress mode =

Compressika is pretty streight forward. You run the executable and you get all your options in a single dialog box:
  * 1. Open Compressika aplication
  * 2. Browse to your input file (file that you want compressed/decompressed)
  * 3. Browse to your output file (location where you want your file to be compressed/decompressed)
  * 4. Select wanted algorithm 
  * 5. Click compress/uncompress

If you compress with a lossless algorithm (any but fractal) you will get an aditional .crc file (for error checking).
